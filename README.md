# Rockbusterproject
SQL project for a movie rental company (Rockbuster Stealth L.L.C) with physical stores worldwide. The company plans to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service which they hope will help them compete with streaming giants such as Netflix and Amazon Prime. 
This project helps to obtain data-driven answers on questions about their most valuable customers, movie genres and countries/regions where they have the highest customer base.
The analysis also provides recommendations that can be used for their 2020 strategy/economic planning.
